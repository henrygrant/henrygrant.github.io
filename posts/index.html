          Current setting: Coffee shop in Blowing Rock, NC. It&rsquo;s called Bald Guy Brew.
My dad, both sisters and my middle sister&rsquo;s boyfriend went skiing up at Beech Mountain, near Banner Elk, NC. After a couple of runs I got the hang of it, managing to be able to make it down the tallest open slope they had going. It was pretty sick, there was a bar at the top that sold PBR.

          I have to wonder if if this uncommon and not everyone experiences this.
Relatively often I get anxiety attacks. At least, I think that&rsquo;s what they are and is what I will refer to them for now. Something usually sets them off, today&rsquo;s being a text message from an old friend that brought up some feelings i&rsquo;d had buried for a while. That was at around 18:00, yet essentially ruined the rest of my day.

          I have mixed feelings about people with very specific coffee orders. As someone who generally gets something very simple: a black coffee or an americano, I wan&rsquo;t to hate those people who get the seasonal pumpkin waffle latte with two pumps of caramel, oat milk, an extra shot of espresso. However, I don&rsquo;t think I can. Delis are one of my favorite things in life. When you find yourself in a serious deli, particularly in the Northeast united states, if you&rsquo;re not getting a Italian Hero you better be ready to spit out exactly what you want, and I do*.

          Every couple of months I decide to quit a vice. Before you congratulate me, know that it has never stuck. Drinking and smoking are (historically) two of my favorite things that I just can&rsquo;t seem to kick.
Anyway, quitting drinking usually comes with some side effects. One of these is a drastically impacted sleep schedule. When you&rsquo;re a habitual drinker, sleep comes easy. You hear your alarm, you grumble, you drag yourself out of bed, you get ready for work, you work, you get off work, you head to the bar, grab dinner with some friends, head back to the bar.
