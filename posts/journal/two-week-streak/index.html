        <p>I have mixed feelings about people with very specific coffee orders. As someone who generally gets something very simple: a black coffee or an americano, I wan&rsquo;t to hate those people who get the seasonal pumpkin waffle latte with two pumps of caramel, oat milk, an extra shot of espresso. However, I don&rsquo;t think I can. Delis are one of my favorite things in life. When you find yourself in a serious deli, particularly in the Northeast united states, if you&rsquo;re not getting a Italian Hero you better be ready to spit out exactly what you want, and I do*. My judgement of people with specific orders at the coffee shop stops today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have preferred to come back to this little coffee shop on a Monday morning but that certainly wasn&rsquo;t happening after the weekend I had. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s going to be a cold week and looking to be a wet weekend. I think I&rsquo;m going to give Final Fantasy XIV a spin to keep me busy.</p>
<p>There are a few other things on my todo list. Primarily, getting Christmas presents for my family, figuring out why my front bike tire keeps popping despite <em>being hung on the wall</em>, and attempting to get this v2 of the Fixed Federation site online. I should have plenty of time, and if I can line that up with the new HQ launch we&rsquo;ll be in business.</p>
<p>Pressure is slowly rising at work. I&rsquo;m finally giving React Native a go today, which reminds me that my next hardcore learning session is probably going to be making an iOS app in Swift though my boss would prefer it to be a deep dive into DynamoDB. Regardless, I&rsquo;m hoping I can bust out this mobile stuff quickly.</p>
<p>Alright, that&rsquo;s all I got for now. I do think I&rsquo;m going to separate these writings into a &ldquo;journal&rdquo; category and an &ldquo;article&rdquo; category. These journal writings are really for me, I don&rsquo;t really expect anyone to consume them. As I get more accustomed to writing again though, I&rsquo;d like to write some articles on topics I&rsquo;m knowledgeable enough on and submit them some places to encourage some reading.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
