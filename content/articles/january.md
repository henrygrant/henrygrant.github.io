Checking in. 

Anxiety is a weird one, and I feel like I'm beating a dead horse. There are at least a couple of developments though. I started on a pill that's supposed to help (supposed to take a while before I notice), and I'm inching closer to actually getting a therapist, trying to make an appointment with a shrink to get adhd pills. I feel less concerned about the shrink though, I can manage adhd, but not the anxiety. I really screwed myself over Saturday night, drinking too much among other things. The resulting anxiety and bad mood was pretty crippling Sunday. 

In other news, I started running. Like I really started running. At the beginning of the year I was getting in about a mile, granted I did have a good pace off the bat. I'm a stats nerd and have been using [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1542509) to track everything, and you can really see marked improvement. Current best was a 5k at a 7:45 pace. It's nice out there. It's hard, your mind can wander a bit but is yanked back to reality now and again, usually for weirdness in the road, or traffic, or something like that. It hurts the whole time too, but I think that goes away after a while. 

I read a [memoir by Haruki Murakami](https://www.amazon.com/What-Talk-About-When-Running/dp/0307389839) who is, among other things, a marathon runner. I would say that seeing the inside of Murakami's head is wild, but it's exactly the opposite. Very cool, calm, collected. Which I suppose is wild to me, as mine is the opposite. 

I've also been thinking about next steps, for my life. I got pre-approved for a mortgage as if I am going to buy a house soon. The more I look though, the more I kind of feel that I don't want to stick around. I've been feeling alienated lately. Maybe another year. Find a cheaper apartment, save more money. Hell, maybe I jet in April. 

Hopefully the next thing I write is an actual article. This brain dump stuff makes me feel better, but I don't see it as content, or art, or whatever.
