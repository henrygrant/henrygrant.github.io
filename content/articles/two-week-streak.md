I have mixed feelings about people with very specific coffee orders. As someone who generally gets something very simple: a black coffee or an americano, I wan't to hate those people who get the seasonal pumpkin waffle latte with two pumps of caramel, oat milk, an extra shot of espresso. However, I don't think I can. Delis are one of my favorite things in life. When you find yourself in a serious deli, particularly in the Northeast united states, if you're not getting a Italian Hero you better be ready to spit out exactly what you want, and I do*. My judgement of people with specific orders at the coffee shop stops today. 

I'd have preferred to come back to this little coffee shop on a Monday morning but that certainly wasn't happening after the weekend I had. Furthermore, it's going to be a cold week and looking to be a wet weekend. I think I'm going to give Final Fantasy XIV a spin to keep me busy. 

There are a few other things on my todo list. Primarily, getting Christmas presents for my family, figuring out why my front bike tire keeps popping despite _being hung on the wall_, and attempting to get this v2 of the Fixed Federation site online. I should have plenty of time, and if I can line that up with the new HQ launch we'll be in business.

Pressure is slowly rising at work. I'm finally giving React Native a go today, which reminds me that my next hardcore learning session is probably going to be making an iOS app in Swift though my boss would prefer it to be a deep dive into DynamoDB. Regardless, I'm hoping I can bust out this mobile stuff quickly. 

Alright, that's all I got for now. I do think I'm going to separate these writings into a "journal" category and an "article" category. These journal writings are really for me, I don't really expect anyone to consume them. As I get more accustomed to writing again though, I'd like to write some articles on topics I'm knowledgeable enough on and submit them some places to encourage some reading. 

Cheers.
