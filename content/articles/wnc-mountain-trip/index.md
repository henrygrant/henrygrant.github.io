Current setting: Coffee shop in Blowing Rock, NC. It's called Bald Guy Brew.

My dad, both sisters and my middle sister's boyfriend went skiing up at Beech Mountain, near Banner Elk, NC. After a couple of runs I got the hang of it, managing to be able to make it down the tallest open slope they had going. It was pretty sick, there was a bar at the top that sold PBR. 

There really is nothing like flying down a mountain like that. The rush I get from that reminds me of bombing N Tryon headed out of uptown at full speed on my Masi. 

All things considered, I think I'll go snowboarding next time and try to get good at it. I remember being trash at snowboarding as a kid, but I was in much worse shape back then so that probably played into it. I think I could pick it up pretty fast.

I also went to this pizza shop meets candy shop meets arcade meets dive bar called called Brick Oven on Beech Mtn. Crazy busy given it's location, but it reminded me of a pizza shop I worked at in Charleston called Gilroy's. And they had Miller diesels, which I had never seen before in my whole life.

I woke up in Banner Elk halfway expecting my sister to want to go hit the slopes again, but (fortunately) she was beat and headed back to Greenville. Given that I have the rest of the week off, I figured I'd go explore a bit. First stop is where I'm currently sitting, the town of Blowing Rock. Later I'm going to see if I can go actually _see_ this the town's namesake, but for now I'm just hiding in this little shop.

This place is like the quintessential little mountain town. Everyone is super nice, snow is all over the place, and I'm sure there's some place I can go "mine for gems" around the corner. 

It doesn't seem that it's a well-kept secret though. Just looking at the Zillow listings, there are no houses under 300k and empty lots look to float around 100k. Barely any availability. 

I really wish I could figure out what the right move is, living-wise. In the meantime I'll just keep saving.
