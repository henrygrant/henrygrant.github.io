# Hi there

I'm Henry and this site is where I write stuff down. Stuff I write about will change, there is no set topic here. Hot topics for me at the time of writing include but are not limited to:

- Programming, and stuff around that
- Bicycles
- Health in general I suppose
- Managing anxiety
- Travel
- Music I'm into

I'm going to try to logically separate the more journal-type entries from the article-type entries, but for now this is basically a homemade tumblr blog. With fewer features. It'll change over time, I've redid this site 3 times before I ever wrote anything. 

Anyway, if you want to reach out to me you can check the links in the header. Thanks for reading.
