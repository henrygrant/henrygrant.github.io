[{"categories":null,"contents":"Recently I was driving through the mountains of Western North Carolina shortly after a snowfall. Even on the small, winding roads that lead up to Banner Elk, each were plowed and salted just as Downtown Anywhere would be at this part of the season. Long driveways that twisted out of sight to people\u0026rsquo;s properties were all nicely plowed as well.\nEventually I passed the place that shoulders the burden of responsibility keeping the roads clear. It was a small building with a bunch of vehicles parked around, notably three or four trucks each equipped with a plow in the front and a bucket in the back. It was half past seven in the morning when I drove by, and clearly the drivers of these trucks had already completed their work for the day.\nIn the past, my first thought about the people who do the job of keeping the roads clear would be about how difficult it must be to get up in the middle of the night to ensure the residents and visitors of the mountain could get around the next morning. Instead, I thought about how rewarding it must be to have such a tangibly important role in the operation of a community. Every neighbor, business, church, and school needs these drivers to function and even though they are paying a fee to these drivers either directly or via their taxes, this service is really more valuable than the money they receive. If the plowing business decided to close up shop, who\u0026rsquo;s to say if there are more folks on this mountain with the skills or grit to take their place? Or if the service from the next mountain over has the capacity to plow this mountain as well?\nThe folks who plow the roads of the mountain are providing a critical service to the community, and anyone who is invested in that community knows it. The owner of the coffee shop in town owes them a debt that a monthly invoice payment and free coffee for life really doesn\u0026rsquo;t cover, but the drivers do it anyway because it needs to be done.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been a professional software developer for about five years, mostly in the financial sector. While my career has so far been rewarding in a fiscal sense, the times i\u0026rsquo;ve found it rewarding in the way that the truck drivers must find theirs are few and far between. Perhaps when I\u0026rsquo;ve mentored someone new to the field, or helped a team get a large project over the finish line, but being one one-hundred-thousandth of the machine that enables you to put your money into the ether and pull it back out as-needed just doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit the same as being the sole reason you can leave your house in the morning.\nMy neighborhood has a watering hole that I somewhat frequent, along with some pillars of my community such as the general manager of the neighborhood diner, the owner of the neighborhood concert venue, the neighborhood barber, among others. While the services these folks provide may not reach the level of importance that the truck drivers on the mountain hold, I still see them in the same sort of light. If one of them decided to throw in the towel, that would have a noticeable impact on my life. If I were to take a sabbatical, the only people that would be impacted are my teammates, and that impact would be minor in the grand scheme of things.\nThese jobs that come with a responsibility to a community, whether critical like the road plowers or less so like the barber, come along with a sense of identity that I long for. From what I can tell, most of the folks that I work with get their sense of identity through other roles that they fill, such as a partner, or a parent, which have their own set of responsibilities. In the past, working in an office setting, there were other responsibilities that could be picked up such as the social organizer for the folks that didn\u0026rsquo;t have a family at home. Given the state of the industry though, nearly everything is remote. While I could look for an in-person role, the \u0026ldquo;be at your desk\u0026rdquo; culture that comes with the in-office nine-to-five is still taxing on my mental health, albeit in a different way, and while it may placate the lack of a sense of identity that I\u0026rsquo;m struggling with, I don\u0026rsquo;t think it would truly solve it.\nThere are things one can and should do, such as joining a gym and social clubs that assist with this, but in my eyes a person\u0026rsquo;s job is the main definer of their contributions to society/their community and these sorts of things are just satellites around the planet of unfulfillment.\n","date":"Jan 07","permalink":"https://henrygrant.github.io/articles/journal/lacking-identity/","tags":null,"title":"Lacking Identity"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Current setting: Coffee shop in Blowing Rock, NC. It\u0026rsquo;s called Bald Guy Brew.\nMy dad, both sisters and my middle sister\u0026rsquo;s boyfriend went skiing up at Beech Mountain, near Banner Elk, NC. After a couple of runs I got the hang of it, managing to be able to make it down the tallest open slope they had going. It was pretty sick, there was a bar at the top that sold PBR.\nThere really is nothing like flying down a mountain like that. The rush I get from that reminds me of bombing N Tryon headed out of uptown at full speed on my Masi.\nAll things considered, I think I\u0026rsquo;ll go snowboarding next time and try to get good at it. I remember being trash at snowboarding as a kid, but I was in much worse shape back then so that probably played into it. I think I could pick it up pretty fast.\nI also went to this pizza shop meets candy shop meets arcade meets dive bar called called Brick Oven on Beech Mtn. Crazy busy given it\u0026rsquo;s location, but it reminded me of a pizza shop I worked at in Charleston called Gilroy\u0026rsquo;s. And they had Miller diesels, which I had never seen before in my whole life.\nI woke up in Banner Elk halfway expecting my sister to want to go hit the slopes again, but (fortunately) she was beat and headed back to Greenville. Given that I have the rest of the week off, I figured I\u0026rsquo;d go explore a bit. First stop is where I\u0026rsquo;m currently sitting, the town of Blowing Rock. Later I\u0026rsquo;m going to see if I can go actually see this the town\u0026rsquo;s namesake, but for now I\u0026rsquo;m just hiding in this little shop.\nThis place is like the quintessential little mountain town. Everyone is super nice, snow is all over the place, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure there\u0026rsquo;s some place I can go \u0026ldquo;mine for gems\u0026rdquo; around the corner.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem that it\u0026rsquo;s a well-kept secret though. Just looking at the Zillow listings, there is no houses under 300k and empty lots look to float around 100k.\nI really wish I could figure out what the right move is, living-wise. I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m relatively high income for North Carolina, and I have the privilege of working remote. That should mean I could come buy a \u0026ldquo;starter home\u0026rdquo; type of place around here and actually live in it, but that just doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be the case. I don\u0026rsquo;t exactly have anyone I can ask about financial decisions though, so maybe hunting down a financial advisor is the move. In the meantime I\u0026rsquo;ll just keep saving.\n","date":"Jan 06","permalink":"https://henrygrant.github.io/articles/journal/wnc-mountains/","tags":null,"title":"WNC Mountains"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I have mixed feelings about people with very specific coffee orders. As someone who generally gets something very simple: a black coffee or an americano, I wan\u0026rsquo;t to hate those people who get the seasonal pumpkin waffle latte with two pumps of caramel, oat milk, an extra shot of espresso. However, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I can. Delis are one of my favorite things in life. When you find yourself in a serious deli, particularly in the Northeast united states, if you\u0026rsquo;re not getting a Italian Hero you better be ready to spit out exactly what you want, and I do*. My judgement of people with specific orders at the coffee shop stops today.\nI\u0026rsquo;d have preferred to come back to this little coffee shop on a Monday morning but that certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t happening after the weekend I had. Furthermore, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be a cold week and looking to be a wet weekend. I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to give Final Fantasy XIV a spin to keep me busy.\nThere are a few other things on my todo list. Primarily, getting Christmas presents for my family, figuring out why my front bike tire keeps popping despite being hung on the wall, and attempting to get this v2 of the Fixed Federation site online. I should have plenty of time, and if I can line that up with the new HQ launch we\u0026rsquo;ll be in business.\nPressure is slowly rising at work. I\u0026rsquo;m finally giving React Native a go today, which reminds me that my next hardcore learning session is probably going to be making an iOS app in Swift though my boss would prefer it to be a deep dive into DynamoDB. Regardless, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping I can bust out this mobile stuff quickly.\nAlright, that\u0026rsquo;s all I got for now. I do think I\u0026rsquo;m going to separate these writings into a \u0026ldquo;journal\u0026rdquo; category and an \u0026ldquo;article\u0026rdquo; category. These journal writings are really for me, I don\u0026rsquo;t really expect anyone to consume them. As I get more accustomed to writing again though, I\u0026rsquo;d like to write some articles on topics I\u0026rsquo;m knowledgeable enough on and submit them some places to encourage some reading.\nCheers.\n* My typical is turkey, bacon, red onion, tomato, shredded lettuce, mayo, seedy deli mustard, and avocado if they have it.\n** After 10 minutes of attempting to understand this NoSQL db, it\u0026rsquo;s like baby Cassandra? I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to need to read the book.\n","date":"Dec 07","permalink":"https://henrygrant.github.io/articles/journal/two-week-streak/","tags":null,"title":"Two Week Streak"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Every couple of months I decide to quit a vice. Before you congratulate me, know that it has never stuck. Drinking and smoking are (historically) two of my favorite things that I just can\u0026rsquo;t seem to kick.\nAnyway, quitting drinking usually comes with some side effects. One of these is a drastically impacted sleep schedule. When you\u0026rsquo;re a habitual drinker, sleep comes easy. You hear your alarm, you grumble, you drag yourself out of bed, you get ready for work, you work, you get off work, you head to the bar, grab dinner with some friends, head back to the bar. Eventually you head home, and by that time sleep comes easy. Repeat.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not knocking this routine, especially as a single man. I do not have a partner/children back at home that would be harmed by this behavior. Hell, one has a better shot at finding said partner at the bar than I do at home on my sofa. It gives you some friends to talk to. It helps you deal with the stress of the day. Plenty of benefits.\nThat lifestyle comes with some harms as well. You get kind of locked into this routine. Your body doesn\u0026rsquo;t really know how to respond for the first few days after stopping. Recently I\u0026rsquo;ve had nights that my body couldn\u0026rsquo;t fall asleep until very very late and nights that I fell asleep at 9pm. I imagine this settles out after a couple of weeks, though I can\u0026rsquo;t be sure as I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve ever tried to quit drinking for more than a couple of weeks.\nThe reason for the title of this entry is that this isn\u0026rsquo;t the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve been sitting in a coffee shop at 6am trying to write something off the top of my head. The last time was a month or two ago where I attempted to write an article about the history of Tumblr. It was intended to be the first post to a blog I was making, though I never finished writing it. I had quit drinking for a bit a couple of days before I wrote that.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if abstaining from alcohol for a couple of days gets the creative juices flowing, or if the onset of sobriety inspires a sort of identity crisis that forces me to want to write something down. Either way, there has to be some correlation between the sober week and the desire to write. I want to write, I\u0026rsquo;ve said this for a long time. I just never seem to actually get around to it when I\u0026rsquo;m on the ride that is the normal routine. Regardless of future drinking habits I think I\u0026rsquo;ll try to stick with it this time.\nMaybe actually finishing this entry is a good omen.\n","date":"Dec 01","permalink":"https://henrygrant.github.io/articles/journal/here-i-am-again/","tags":null,"title":"Here I am again"},{"categories":null,"contents":"   Hi there  My name is Henry and this site is where I write stuff down.\n","date":"Jan 01","permalink":"https://henrygrant.github.io/about/","tags":null,"title":"About"}]
