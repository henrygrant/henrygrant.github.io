        <p>Current setting: Coffee shop in Blowing Rock, NC. It&rsquo;s called Bald Guy Brew.</p>
<p>My dad, both sisters and my middle sister&rsquo;s boyfriend went skiing up at Beech Mountain, near Banner Elk, NC. After a couple of runs I got the hang of it, managing to be able to make it down the tallest open slope they had going. It was pretty sick, there was a bar at the top that sold PBR.</p>
<p>There really is nothing like flying down a mountain like that. The rush I get from that reminds me of bombing N Tryon headed out of uptown at full speed on my Masi.</p>
<p>All things considered, I think I&rsquo;ll go snowboarding next time and try to get good at it. I remember being trash at snowboarding as a kid, but I was in much worse shape back then so that probably played into it. I think I could pick it up pretty fast.</p>
<p>I also went to this pizza shop meets candy shop meets arcade meets dive bar called called Brick Oven on Beech Mtn. Crazy busy given it&rsquo;s location, but it reminded me of a pizza shop I worked at in Charleston called Gilroy&rsquo;s. And they had Miller diesels, which I had never seen before in my whole life.</p>

<p>I woke up in Banner Elk halfway expecting my sister to want to go hit the slopes again, but (fortunately) she was beat and headed back to Greenville. Given that I have the rest of the week off, I figured I&rsquo;d go explore a bit. First stop is where I&rsquo;m currently sitting, the town of Blowing Rock. Later I&rsquo;m going to see if I can go actually <em>see</em> this the town&rsquo;s namesake, but for now I&rsquo;m just hiding in this little shop.</p>
<p>This place is like the quintessential little mountain town. Everyone is super nice, snow is all over the place, and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some place I can go &ldquo;mine for gems&rdquo; around the corner.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem that it&rsquo;s a well-kept secret though. Just looking at the Zillow listings, there is no houses under 300k and empty lots look to float around 100k.</p>
<p>I really wish I could figure out what the right move is, living-wise. I feel like I&rsquo;m relatively high income for North Carolina, and I have the privilege of working remote. That <em>should</em> mean I could come buy a &ldquo;starter home&rdquo; type of place around here and actually live in it, but that just doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case. I don&rsquo;t exactly have anyone I can ask about financial decisions though, so maybe hunting down a financial advisor is the move. In the meantime I&rsquo;ll just keep saving.</p>
