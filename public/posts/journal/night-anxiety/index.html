        <p>I have to wonder if if this uncommon and not everyone experiences this.</p>
<p>Relatively often I get anxiety attacks. At least, I think that&rsquo;s what they are and is what I will refer to them for now. Something <em>usually</em> sets them off, today&rsquo;s being a text message from an old friend that brought up some feelings i&rsquo;d had buried for a while. That was at around 18:00, yet essentially ruined the rest of my day. I began to worry about everything I could possibly worry about. I finally get a hold of my mother and bickered with her about Christmas, which makes her feel bad and inevitably makes me feel worse. Afterwards I headed home and tried to enjoy some television but I got tired after about 30 minutes and took it to bed around 21:00, around two or three hours sooner than I generally would go to sleep.</p>
<p>Switching to present tense because this is where I currently am.</p>
<p>I dream* and have put my recollection below.</p>
<p>I wake up hoping its morning so I can start getting ready to sweat out the previous day&rsquo;s anxiety at the gym.Unfortunately, its actually about 1:00 and a wave of dread comes over me about having to lie here hoping I can get my head to calm down enough to go back to sleep. If I could, maybe I could wake up before the gym and do some writing. Definitely not going to happen though, my head spinning about anything I could be anxious about. Why I can&rsquo;t enjoy a TV show like a normal person. Why I can&rsquo;t enjoy free time for that matter. Why I have issues with the people I grew up with (not the ones from the dream, the one relevant to the initial phone call). Why the cute girl at work seems to have all of her ducks in a row while I&rsquo;m a train wreck. Why no one would ever want to be with someone like this. Why I should still be on ADHD medication. Why I should be on SSRIs. It goes on.</p>
<p>I write about it.</p>
<p>I feel marginally better that I wrote something down about the situation.</p>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>* Dream:

I'm sitting in a bar or something, chatting with a few guys. Someone comes in who I wouldn't mind hanging out with, but I tell them I have a birthday(?) party to go to nearby but I'll swing back by later. 

I leave said bar and I'm in some kind of outdoor mall, and upon making my way to my destination I discover it is being held at a place I'd describe as cross between a brewery and a Gamestop. I see some people I was friends with in middle/high school out front at the picnic tables, but don't immediately approach them. Instead I head inside to talk to the guy who appears to be the drummer for a band that just played. I know him, another person from middle/high school I haven't seen in 10 years and apparently the person who's birthday we're celebrating. We say hey and he asks if I brought my pokemon cartridge, which I did not.

I'll mention that none of these people have I ever been particularly close to, nor desired to be really. These were basically just classmates from awhile ago. There are some people from high school that I would prefer to see or avoid more than others, but I haven't given much thought to any of these people in a while.
