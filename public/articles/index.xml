      <description>Recently I was driving through the mountains of Western North Carolina shortly after a snowfall. Even on the small, winding roads that lead up to Banner Elk, each were plowed and salted just as Downtown Anywhere would be at this part of the season. Long driveways that twisted out of sight to people&amp;rsquo;s properties were all nicely plowed as well.
Eventually I passed the place that shoulders the burden of responsibility keeping the roads clear.</description>

      <description>Current setting: Coffee shop in Blowing Rock, NC. It&amp;rsquo;s called Bald Guy Brew.
My dad, both sisters and my middle sister&amp;rsquo;s boyfriend went skiing up at Beech Mountain, near Banner Elk, NC. After a couple of runs I got the hang of it, managing to be able to make it down the tallest open slope they had going. It was pretty sick, there was a bar at the top that sold PBR.</description>

      <description>I have mixed feelings about people with very specific coffee orders. As someone who generally gets something very simple: a black coffee or an americano, I wan&amp;rsquo;t to hate those people who get the seasonal pumpkin waffle latte with two pumps of caramel, oat milk, an extra shot of espresso. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can. Delis are one of my favorite things in life. When you find yourself in a serious deli, particularly in the Northeast united states, if you&amp;rsquo;re not getting a Italian Hero you better be ready to spit out exactly what you want, and I do*.</description>

      <description>Every couple of months I decide to quit a vice. Before you congratulate me, know that it has never stuck. Drinking and smoking are (historically) two of my favorite things that I just can&amp;rsquo;t seem to kick.
Anyway, quitting drinking usually comes with some side effects. One of these is a drastically impacted sleep schedule. When you&amp;rsquo;re a habitual drinker, sleep comes easy. You hear your alarm, you grumble, you drag yourself out of bed, you get ready for work, you work, you get off work, you head to the bar, grab dinner with some friends, head back to the bar.</description>
