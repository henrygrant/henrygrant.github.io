<p>Every couple of months I decide to quit a vice. Before you congratulate me, know that it has never stuck. Drinking and smoking are (historically) two of my favorite things that I just can&rsquo;t seem to kick.</p>
<p>Anyway, quitting drinking usually comes with some side effects. One of these is a drastically impacted sleep schedule. When you&rsquo;re a habitual drinker, sleep comes easy. You hear your alarm, you grumble, you drag yourself out of bed, you get ready for work, you work, you get off work, you head to the bar, grab dinner with some friends, head back to the bar. Eventually you head home, and by that time sleep comes easy. Repeat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not knocking this routine, especially as a single man. I do not have a partner/children back at home that would be harmed by this behavior. Hell, one has a better shot at finding said partner at the bar than I do at home on my sofa. It gives you some friends to talk to. It helps you deal with the stress of the day. Plenty of benefits.</p>
<p>That lifestyle comes with some harms as well. You get kind of locked into this routine. Your body doesn&rsquo;t really know how to respond for the first few days after stopping. Recently I&rsquo;ve had nights that my body couldn&rsquo;t fall asleep until very very late and nights that I fell asleep at 9pm. I imagine this settles out after a couple of weeks, though I can&rsquo;t be sure as I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever tried to quit drinking for more than a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The reason for the title of this entry is that this isn&rsquo;t the first time I&rsquo;ve been sitting in a coffee shop at 6am trying to write something off the top of my head. The last time was a month or two ago where I attempted to write an article about the history of Tumblr. It was intended to be the first post to a blog I was making, though I never finished writing it. I had quit drinking for a bit a couple of days before I wrote that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if abstaining from alcohol for a couple of days gets the creative juices flowing, or if the onset of sobriety inspires a sort of identity crisis that forces me to want to write something down. Either way, there has to be some correlation between the sober week and the desire to write. I want to write, I&rsquo;ve said this for a long time. I just never seem to actually get around to it when I&rsquo;m on the ride that is the normal routine. Regardless of future drinking habits I think I&rsquo;ll try to stick with it this time.</p>
<p>Maybe actually finishing this entry is a good omen.</p>
